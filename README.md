# Dungeon-Dragon-Character-Manager
This is a fun project that I did during my junior year of college. It is a character manager for dungeons and dragons. You can enter your character sheet and store it into a DB for later! I built this on my local computer utilizing a combination of eclipse and netbeans.
With eclipse I used tomcat as a server and with netbeans I used glassfish. 
This is merely a snapshot of what I have as the file structure is slightly different in both setups. 
I just thought I would post the base files. This comes complete with a basic account setup and recovery mechanism.
I styled the whole thing with Bootstrap 3. This was before I really got into the Spring and Hibernate tools.
